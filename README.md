STAC Tiling Performance Test
=====

This repo will hold software and sample data to compare STAC dynamic raster tile services.
It's starting with [`titiler`](https://github.com/developmentseed/titiler) and [Franklin](https://github.com/azavea/franklin)
because those are the easiest two implementations to set up. If there are tiling implementations I've missed that you think
should be included, please [open an issue](https://github.com/jisantuc/stac-tiling-performance/issues/new?template=tiling-implementation.md).
